// A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things:
//a function, and the environment in which that function was created.

// The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time that the closure was created. 
//A closure lets you associate some data (the environment) with a function that operates on that data. 

//我对闭包的理解：
/*
 *首先闭包是一个函数
 *然后闭包是一个内部函数
 *最后这个内部函数可以访问到它被创建的时候的环境 
 */
